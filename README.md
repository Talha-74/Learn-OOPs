## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental programming paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities as objects and define their behavior through classes and methods. OOP is widely used in software development and provides a structured approach to building complex applications.

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive learning resource for OOP. It includes explanations, code examples, and exercises in various programming languages, making it accessible to learners with different language preferences.

## Getting Started

To get started with Learn-OOPs, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Talha7447/Learn-OOPs.git


 ## Topics Covered
   ### Data Encapsulation
   #### Definition
   Data Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves bundling the data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called a class. The key principles of encapsulation are information hiding and data protection. In PHP, and specifically in Laravel, data encapsulation is essential for various reasons.
   #### Why do we use it?
- **Security**:
  Encapsulation allows you to restrict access to certain data and methods, providing a level of security. You can make data private or protected to prevent unauthorized external access.

- **Modularity**:
  Encapsulation makes it easier to manage and maintain your code. You can change the internal workings of a class without affecting the external code that uses it.

- **Abstraction**:
  Encapsulation abstracts the complexity of a class's implementation, exposing only what is necessary for the user to interact with. This makes your code more readable and less error-prone.

- **Code Organization**:
  Encapsulation helps organize your code by grouping related data and behavior together within a class.
  
#### Where do we use it?
You can use data encapsulation in PHP OOP in any project that employs object-oriented design principles. Common places to use encapsulation include:
Creating classes for modeling objects in your application (e.g., User, Product, Order, etc.).
Developing libraries or packages where classes should provide an intuitive and safe interface to the user.
Ensuring proper access control for database connections, user authentication, or any sensitive information.

#### Real-World Examples:
Bank Account: A BankAccount class could encapsulate balance, account number, and methods like deposit and withdraw. The balance would be private, and transactions controlled through methods.
Employee Records: An Employee class could encapsulate employee details like name, address, and salary while providing methods to update and retrieve this information.
#### Use in Laravel:
In Laravel, encapsulation is applied in various ways, primarily within the framework's core components:
Eloquent Models: Eloquent models encapsulate database tables, allowing you to interact with database records as objects. For example, you can define an Article model that represents an "articles" table and encapsulates data and methods for interacting with articles.
- **Service Providers**: Laravel's service providers encapsulate the registration of services and binding of components. They help to organize and abstract the complex setup of services, making it more maintainable and understandable.
- **Middleware:** Middleware in Laravel encapsulates HTTP request handling logic, allowing you to filter and modify requests and responses. Middleware classes encapsulate different aspects of request processing, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.
- **Authentication**: Laravel's authentication system encapsulates user authentication, registration, and password reset functionality, making it easy to include secure user authentication in your application.
In Laravel, and in PHP OOP in general, data encapsulation is a crucial principle for maintaining clean, secure, and modular code. It helps make your code more organized, secure, and maintainable by hiding implementation details and exposing a well-defined interface.
